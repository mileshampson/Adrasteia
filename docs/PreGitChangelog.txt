Revision History:
 -Version 0.3.3 (current)
        - Changed p-value display format to scientific notation
        - Improved display format for header information
        - Updated Readme.txt

 -Version 0.3.2
        - Added a cut-off variable contolling the p-values of
          the results displayed to the user.
        - Changed the order of index creation so that everything
          is written to disk before an attempt is made to load
          indices (in case of failure).
          
 -Version 0.3.1
        -Resolved the occasional crashing on index creation bug
        -Improved the performance testing in the Measurment module
        -Fixed the error checking for the correct query length
        
    -Version 0.3.0
        -Implemented group matching feature
        -Added more detailed information to readme
        -Added more cases to testsuite and demonstration
    
    -Version 0.3.0 RC1
        -Implemented proper partition matching (as in agrep) for scws 
        -Allows seperate error rates for each query in a batch
        -Index data is now written to disk, so that only one
         indexing session needs to be done for a database even
         if the program is restarted.
         
    -Version 0.2.0
        -Implemented better checking of input data.
        -Included a Test Suite.
        
    -Version 0.2 RC2
        - Fixed bug where the lagrepy module of agrepy crashed
          on 64 bit architectures.
          
    -Version 0.2 RC1
        -Implemented multiple query matching for both direct and
         preprocessed matches.
        -Removed dependencies on Numeric libraries, and slow
         recursive function for combinations
         
    -Version 0.11
        -Changed directory structure slightly to fix compile errors
        -Fixed legal information
        -Removed table of means from calculation of p-values
        
    -Version 0.1.0
        - Implemented p-values and sorting of results
        - Now returns information about area near match
        - Switch to direct match for potentially slow matches
        
    -Version 0.09
        - Allowed specification of some more command line args
        - Implemented basic scoring of results
        
    -Version 0.08
        - Changed dropset calculation to return next matching result
        - Rewrote init to parse every possible triplet of each record,
          so that there was less computation to be done in match
    
    -Version 0.05
        - Wrote recursive function to calculate all possible permutations
          of errors in the sequence partition, thus greatly reducing the
          dropset, at the cost of a very slow match calculation for high
          error rates

TODO:  
    Bugs:
        (major) -The lagrepy module of agrepy does not work on 64 bit platforms.
                 At the moment a test is done to see if we are running on one
                 of these platforms, and if so then use the sagrepy module for
                 all queries. As this becomes inefficent for queries above length
                 30, sagrepy should be rewritten to run on these architectures.
                -The output is in the wrong format when the p value threshold
		 reduces the result set to zero
    Features:
        (major) - Implement parsers for databases other than FASTA
                - Remove false drops for multiple matches
                - Use table of standard deviations as well as table of means
